# E-commerce Project Week I


## Requirements

This week you'll build the foundation of your application. It should eventually look like this: [here](https://hyf-react-w1-example.netlify.app)

We will be using the information in the `fake-data` folder as an example of what we get back from the API. The actual connection to the API will be done next week.

What you need to have done at the end of the week:

- A product list that displays all of the products in the `all-products` file. _Note: the site is responsive, so have a look at the breakpoints in the deployed example project._
- A category list that displays all of the categories in the `all-categories` file at the top of the page
- If the user clicks on a category only the products that have that category in their `category` property should be displayed on the screen. _Note: The categories listed in the product objects do *not* match up exactly with the categories in the categories list. You will have to find a solution to this *without* editing the files_
- There should only be 1 category active at a time and the user should see which category is selected.
- You need to deploy your app somewhere (using something like [netlify](https://www.netlify.com)) and put the link in your PR!
